FBX file import:
- Name should carry a meaning: for example Floor1, floor2 or even better: floor_steel, floor_stone, etc...
- Don't generate collider
- Up vector: Y axis (reset transform + rotate pivot)
- Wall FBX: extend axis must be X
- Size: need to be relatively correct when import (not like 100 times bigger or smaller): better to make all asset in 1 3dsmax file & export 1 by 1, with a size reference (Titan height is about 2 unit in 3dsmax)
- Generate UV for lightmap: for all static object
- Don't import animation
- Material generation: Model's name + material name

Prefab making
- Common combination of assets should become a prefab. E.g: a light object with a light sharp.

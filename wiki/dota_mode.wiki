Two side spawn soldiers and attack each other.
Players join the field and support their team.
Destroy enemy's fortress to win the match.

[Tentative design]
Strategy control: player can choose what type of weapons to spawn on each spawn location --> give player decision on what weapon is needed. E.g. if his army reach a choke point, he may need more AOE.

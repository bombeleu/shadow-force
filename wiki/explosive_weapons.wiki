- missile launcher
- grenade launcher

instant kill AOE damage.

balancing idea:
- missile launcher: projectile maybe slow, or can be shot down by machine gun
- grenade launcher: the grenade will bounce at least one time after landing --> hard to aim, easier to dodge, impossible to use on narrow bridge (it will bounce off and fall to abyss)

Current design:
- each player chooses 2 weapons.
- choose 1 ability from this list:
  - lean
  - shield (reduce frontal damage, deflect energy gun)
  - wall leap: landing time create vulnerable time window
  - melee: silent instant kill, even in front
Abilities can be specific to a class (so ability selection will become class selection, if we have enough time to develop art asset)
